# List of system design points

From [this youtube videto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzLMhqg3\_Wc\&list=PL73KFetZlkJSZ9vTDSJ1swZhe6CIYkqTL\&index=2)

* Vertical vs horizontal scaling
* CAP theorem
* Partitiong / Sharding of data -- Consistent hashing
* Optimistic vs pessimistic locking
* Strong vs eventual consistency
* RelationalDB vs NoSQL
* Types of NoSQL -- key value -- wide column -- document based -- graph based
* Caching
* Data center / racks / hosts
* cpu / memory / hard drive / network bandwidth
* random vs sequential disk writes
* http vs http2 vs websockets
* TCP/IP model
* ipv4 vs ipv6
* TCP vs UDP
* DNS lookup
* https anf TLS
* pubic key information (Certificate authority)
* Load balancers -> L4 vs L7
* CDN and edge
* Bloom filters & count-min sketch
* Poxos? Concensus over distributed hosts -- Leader election
* Design patterns & object oriented design (RFP?)
* Listral machines 7 constraints
* Publisher subscriber or queue (integration patterns?)
* map reduce
* Multi threading, concurrency, locks, synchronization, CAS
