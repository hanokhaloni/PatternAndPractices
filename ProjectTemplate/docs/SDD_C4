Software Design Description

# Introduction
This document describes the design of the XYZ software system. The system is a web-based application that allows users to manage their finances, track their spending, and create budgets.

# Use cases
The main user usecases in XYZ system

# Architecture 

## System context
The XYZ system consists of the following components:

A front-end web application built using React.js
A back-end API built using Flask
A database built using MySQL
The front-end and back-end components are connected via a RESTful API, which allows the front-end to send and receive data from the back-end and the database.

## Components
### Front-end
The front-end component is a single-page web application that is served to users' web browsers. It uses React.js to create a dynamic and interactive user interface, and makes API calls to the back-end to retrieve and update data.

### Back-end
The back-end component is a RESTful API that exposes a set of endpoints for the front-end to interact with. It is built using Flask and communicates with the database to store and retrieve data.

## Database
The database component is a MySQL database that stores the user and financial data for the XYZ system. It is accessed by the back-end API to retrieve and update data.

## Design patterns and principles
The XYZ system follows the microservices architecture pattern, with the front-end, back-end, and database components being developed and deployed independently. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability, and makes it easier to update and maintain the system.

The system also follows the SOLID design principles, which are a set of principles that aim to make software designs more understandable, maintainable, and flexible.

# Conclusion
This document provides a detailed description of the design of the XYZ software system. The system is built using modern web technologies and follows a microservices architecture and the SOLID design principles.
