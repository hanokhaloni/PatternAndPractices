# Postmortem format 

## Timeline

- Tell me what happened and ~when (no need to go to any time resolution, justtell what happened when?)
- Use ISO date format to ouline each entry in timeline.

## Detection 

- Who detected how and what (and when)? When did we detect this issue?

## Business impact

- What was the actual buisness impact? Did we lose anything? Was there any downtime?

## Root cause

- Ask why a lot. Don't blame. Try to figure out the root cause of the problem.
- If you were the man behind the bug, What do we need to do in order to prevent such a vulnerability?
- Keep in mind that human error is an effect of systematic Vulnerabilities deeper inside the organization.

## Action items
