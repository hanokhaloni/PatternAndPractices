# Version release checklist
Each version has a SemVer notation "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH" where:
- MAJOR version - denotes project scope (whole)
- MINOR version - denotes project milestone
- PATCH version - denotes small changes

*Make sure that the version number is visible (either in client - text or tooltip, logs, footers or a designated "About" popup)!*
