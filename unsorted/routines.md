# Routines

## Update trunk based

Below is the proposed flow of updating the local codebase with the trunk.

* [ ] Run tests and make sure they pass.
* [ ] Update the trunk folder.
* [ ] Resolve conflicts if needed.
* [ ] Run tests again and make sure they pass. (edited)
* [ ] Have your changeset be reviewed and approved
* [ ] Write a complete check-in comment

## Code reviewed mini-checklist:

* [ ] Show that the code does
* [ ] Show the code
* [ ] Reviewer is driving the keyboard
* [ ] Time frame 20 min
* [ ] Never review a commit for more than 1 day of work
