## How to be profficiant?

```
Keep your commits small.	Small steps are easier to track and to approve.
Write a small design doc before you start	Draft before you start

Set personal goals for commit rate 	One commit per day.
Don't be arrogant	Arrogance WILL NOT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE!
Identify and respect the tech lead


KISS
DRY
YAGNI
